PYTHON 3.7
Put all files in one directory, I used Pycharm IDE to compile/run and test the files
Using UNIX terminal:
    1. Put all files in one directory
    2. cd to current working directory
    3. Type command "python3 a2q6.py /*"
    4. This will test a2q1 using data1.txt
    5. To test different questions delete # mark before the line of code in main() of a2q6.py
    6. After running a test, Average time and RSME will appear on the bottom respectively
